I don't know how to download apk without installing on the Quest.

I was checking what would be the best to create a flycase with the plastic machine or if there were other solution.

- idea: check for cardboard pasta and to do CNC part to give the shape.
- idea: 3D print in plastic that can take the heat or cnc a peace of wood of the flycase shape. Then use the plastic melter to make the shape. Plastic is around 5-6â‚¬
