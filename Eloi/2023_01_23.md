Life is a b**ch... So 0.00-0.05 mm is small but it is enough between friction or not in a tube. So I designed a tube to check what size i need.

During this process I realize something else.

 The white line is the size of the layer switch.
And this line can't be there. So the best way to hold the plotter is to have and adaptator that i can cut inside and put in the ploter.
Just to not reprint every time I have a new plotter from a client or that I have to change.
