We will have to deal with 700 Quests.
So the question of the days is how to deal with that ?
- Installation, tag, track, sideload ...


Apparently you can install APK from file explorer in the android 2D app viewer of Quest.

Video seem a bit shading Not sure it will work. But need to try. 
Look at how to use gdrive  on android

You can install on all the Quest with Oculus Buisness but it is maxium 25 Quests.
And I don't know if it is "free" or available for classic Quest.

**Warning: https://youtu.be/RtO-wQIAMMk?t=198 You can't downgrade from Business Quest to Oculus Consumer Quest...**

Question: Is it really only Business Quest or is there a software way to switch it ?

(Maybe it means that you can have more but can only do 25 at a time.)

Apparently it is "not availaible" anymore. So no need to watch more about it.

You have the choose of one mail per quest that take time and means you need to buy app for all quest.
Or have one but may have random bug  when several are user are using it.
Like I had with Tennis Table Eleven on my two quests. We can both play but can't play together.

ArborXR ?
Apparently a fleet solution to control several headset.
But 10â‚¬ per quest per month... Impossible solution for MolenGeek.
We can use the free version under 50 quests to test a bit the idea but not a good idea.
