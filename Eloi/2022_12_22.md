## Meeting with the team of ArborXR

Adviser: Joe Reta

- They can send adb commands but only the one that meta allow. But adb tcp is obviously not in the list. 
- They plan to have an option for the Lynx.  
- WebGl Link are in the milestone and already done but not publish yet.  
- Education license is around 20% reduction.
- Developer section:
  - https://documentation.xrdm.app/docs/cli/Âµ
- You can't install official application from ArborXR
- Facebook flag blocks  quest when an app run on several device apparently (not harmfull but good to know)
- The guy tip us to look around at the organisation section of the tool.
- they have 2 year of dev for quest and around 6+ on the tool. So they are young but have already a good run

You can add in the application a tool that give info on what is the info of ArborXR for this device.
Can be useful if you need to know what device you are debugging. 
I suppose we can find the in ArborXR Home anyways
