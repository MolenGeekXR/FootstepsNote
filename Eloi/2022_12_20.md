How to set the quest in kiosk mode.
Apparently you can't:

You can use ArborXR but it is expensive.

Question: Business is discontinue, but does it means that we can use it until the end of Oculus Quest 2 if we dont' update ?


-------------

I was looking how to setup Oculus for business and read that:
"Oculus for business is not update to consumer version making some apk impossible to run"
https://forums.oculusvr.com/t5/Quest-Development/Quest-for-Business-is-WAY-Different-than-Quest-for-Consumers/td-p/831920
So I am not sure it is a good idea to continue looking.
