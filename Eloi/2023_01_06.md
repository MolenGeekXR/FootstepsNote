I try to prepare a small workshop with 4 Quest to make it test to the team of Molengeek.
The aim is to not make the Quest take the dust and also to feel the pain of having to setup the devices for an event.


People want to test 
- Beat Saber VR


What they need to test
- MRTK
- Contour


To Advance for beginner but could be nice:
- Echor VR
