# Arbor Xr

Very cool MDM. And kind of the only one on the market.
Found some other at same price but seem less ready to be used.

This application is a must have.
You just connect you Quest to an app on your PC that install two applications (and change some files I suppose) and it allows a "full" control of your Quest in remote.
It as a Kiosk system that you can configure from outside. 

You can add your application in the list and then installed it from the website to your Quest:

- Down side: 
  - You can't launch webxr
  - You can't laucnh "unmanage app" from store


See all app on quest ADB:
´adb shell pm list packages´
