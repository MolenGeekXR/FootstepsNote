Feel free to come here if you want to follow my footsteps to learn what I learned.



Step 1: Unbox 24 headsets

- 9h20 - 10h38   2-4 personnes.
- One = 4 minutes 40
See video


Step 2: Do the first stem, wifi and update

- 10h38  to 11h43 : 15  casques Ã  4 personnes first step update  
- 5 minutes 20 = set one casque before waiting for update to start.

Launch break while all headset reload and update are installing.
So many headset make the internet very slow.
